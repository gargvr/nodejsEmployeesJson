Developer should provide 2 JSON Files
➢ The First JSON File should contain Employee Name along with Employee Details and Project ID
➢ Second JSON File should contain information about the Projects (containing Project ID and
Related Details)
➢ Create 2 APIs, providing the following details:
➢ First API would take the Employee Id as Input and Queries the underlying JSON File to fetch
Employee Data at: (localhost:3000/employee/:id)
➢ Second API would take the Project ID as input and Query the JSON File to fetch Project
Information at: (localhost:3000/project/:id)
➢ Using the above specified APIs, create a new API at: (localhost:3000/getemployeedetails )
This API would get the Employee Data along with the details about the project.
(Make Use of fetch and promise to resolve API)
When a query is made to the Employee API, it will fetch Employee Details, along with the
Project ID. This Project ID can then be used in order to query the Project API to fetch the data.
The resultant data of the API at:(localhost:3000/getemployeedetails) should contain details about the
employee as well as details about his Project and should be returned in form of JSON data to the Client.
